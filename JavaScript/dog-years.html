  <p>
    Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog's age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human's life equates to 45 years in a dog's life. How old would you be if you were a dog?
    Here's how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:
    <ul>
      <li>The first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 dog years each.</li>
      <li>Each year following equates to 4 dog years.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <script>
    // Initializing the myAge variable using constant
    let myAge = 35;

    // initializing the early years value
    let earlyYears = 2;
    earlyYears *= 10.5;

    // Calculating the later years value using myAge variable
    let laterYears = earlyYears - 2;

    //Multiplying the later years value by 4
    laterYears *= 4;
    console.log(`The early years is ${earlyYears}.`);
    console.log(`The later years is ${laterYears}.`);

    // Calculating my age in Dog years
    let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

    // converting the string to a lowercase
    let myName = 'Karthik'.toLowerCase();

    console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
