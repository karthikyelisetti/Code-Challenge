    <h1>Race Day</h1>
    <p>
      Codecademy's annual race is just around the corner! This year, we have a
      lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will
      register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.
      <br />As a timeline, registration would look like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img height="240" src="../images/raceday-timeline.svg" alt="Race Day" />
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years
      of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early
      or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their
      age and registration.
    </p>
    <h4>Race number:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000. All others receive
        a number below 1000.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Start time:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.</li>
      <li>Early adults run at 9:30 am.</li>
      <li>Late adults run at 11:00 am.</li>
      <li>Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      But we didn't plan for runners that are exactly 18! We'll handle that by
      the end of the project.
    </p>
    <script>
      let raceNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
      let runnerRegistered = true;
      let runnerAge = 18;

      if (runnerAge >= 18 && runnerRegistered) {
        raceNumber += 1000;
      }

      if (runnerAge >= 18 && runnerRegistered) {
        console.log(`Runner-${raceNumber} will race at 9:30am `);
      } else if (runnerAge >= 18 && !runnerRegistered) {
        console.log(`Runner-${raceNumber} will race at 11:00am`);
      } else if (runnerAge < 18) {
        console.log(`Runner-${raceNumber} will race at 12:30pm`);
      }
    </script>
