      Magic Eight Ball You've learned a powerful tool in JavaScript: control
      flow! It's so powerful, in fact, that it can be used to tell someone's
      fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project we will build a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8_Ball">Magic Eight Ball</a>
      using control flow in JavaScript. The user will be able to input a
      question, then our program will output a random fortune.
