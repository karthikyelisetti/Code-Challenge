  <h1>Race Day</h1>
  <p>
    Codecademy's annual race is just around the corner! This year, we have a lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.
    <br />As a timeline, registration would look like this:
  </p>
  <p><img height="240" src="../images/raceday-timeline.svg" alt="Race Day" /></p>
  <p>
    Here's how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.
  </p>
  <h4>Race number:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000. All others receive a number below 1000.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Start time:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.</li>
    <li>Early adults run at 9:30 am.</li>
    <li>Late adults run at 11:00 am.</li>
    <li>Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).</li>
  </ul>   

  <p>But we didn't plan for runners that are exactly 18! We'll handle that by the end of the project.</p>
  <script>
    let raceNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
    let runnerRegistered = true;
    let runnerAge = 18;

    if (runnerAge >= 18 && runnerRegistered) {
    raceNumber += 1000;
    }

    if (runnerAge >= 18 && runnerRegistered) {
    console.log(`Runner-${raceNumber} will race at 9:30am `);
    } else if (runnerAge >= 18 && !runnerRegistered) {
    console.log(`Runner-${raceNumber} will race at 11:00am`);
    } else if (runnerAge < 18) {
    console.log(`Runner-${raceNumber} will race at 12:30pm`);
    }
  </script>
